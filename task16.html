        <h2>Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud</h2>
        <!-- Content goes here -->
        <p>The only child of India's longest-serving chief justice, Y. V. Chandrachud, he was educated at Delhi
            University
            and Harvard University and has practiced as a lawyer for Sullivan & Cromwell and in the Bombay High Court.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">After attending the Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai and St. Columba's School,
            Delhi, he graduated with honours in economics and mathematics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi in 1979.[11]
            He then obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from the Faculty of Law at the University of Delhi in 1982,
            followed by a Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School in 1983. He was awarded the prestigious Inlaks
            Scholarship, offered to Indian citizens pursuing graduate education abroad, and received the Joseph H. Beale
            Prize at Harvard.[12] He stayed at Harvard to complete a Doctorate of Juridical Science, which he finished
            in 1986.[13] His doctoral dissertation was on affirmative action where he considered the law in a
            comparative framework.[14]</p>

        <h1>Career</h1>
        <P id="Special-text">Chandrachud studied law at Delhi University in 1982 at a time when few jobs were available
            to young law graduates. He worked for a while, as a junior advocate assisting lawyers and judges, including
            drafting some briefs for Fali Nariman. After graduating from Harvard, Chandrachud first worked at the law
            firm Sullivan and Cromwell. He described this experience as "sheer fluke" due to the strong pecking order
            that existed at that time, and a strong bias against hiring Indians and men from developing countries.[15]
            Upon returning to India, he practiced law at the Supreme Court of India and the Bombay High Court. He was
            designated a Senior Advocate by the Bombay High Court in June 1998. That year, he was appointed an
            Additional Solicitor General of India, a role he held until his appointment as a Judge.</P>

            <h1>Notable judgments </h1>
            <p id="special-text"> During his Supreme Court service, he has been on the highest number of constitutional
                benches (five judges or more) constituted to hear matters on constitutional questions.[18] During his
                tenure
                at the Supreme Court, he has delivered judgements on Indian constitutional law, comparative
                constitutional
                law, human rights, gender justice, public interest litigations, commercial law and criminal law. </p>

            <h1> Right to Privacy</h1>
            <p id="special-text">mong his notable judgments is his lead opinion in the Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.)
                and Anr. vs Union Of
                India And Ors. case as part of a unanimous nine-judge bench decision of the Indian Supreme Court, which
                affirmed that the right to privacy is a constitutionally guaranteed right.[19] Chandrachud grounded the
                right to privacy in dignity, liberty, autonomy, bodily and mental integrity, self-determination and
                across a
                spectrum of protected rights. Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:
                Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and
                freedom
                which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the
                individual.
                It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for
                the
                individual a zone of choice and self-determination.[19]</p>
            <h1> Free speech</h1>
            <p id="special-text">Terming dissent as "the safety valve of democracy",[28][29][30] he has authored
                judgments upholding the right to the freedom of speech in numerous cases. In Indibility Creative Pvt Ltd
                v State of West Bengal,[31] he authored a judgment which imposed a fine on the State of West Bengal and
                granted remedial compensation for disallowing the screening of the political satire Bhobishyoter Bhoot
                through extra-constitutional measures. The Court had, by an interim order, directed that there must be
                no bar on the screening of the movie.[32][33] In the final judgment, Chandrachud held that even if there
                was any apprehension of public discontent, police protection must be provided instead of prohibiting the
                display of the movie. The judgment is noteworthy[34] for its recognition of the positive duty on the
                State to protect the freedom of speech and expression. He held that:</p>
